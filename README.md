| Method   | Endpoint           | Description              |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/books`            | Get all books            |
| `GET`    | `/books/:id`        | Get a single book by ID   |
| `POST`   | `/books`            | Create a new book        |
| `PUT`    | `/books/:id`        | Update a book by ID      |
| `DELETE` | `/books/:id`        | Delete a book by ID      |

### Example Book JSON Structure

```json
{
  "title": "The Great Gatsby",
